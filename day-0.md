# Code Editors
### nano (Linux)
If you want/need to stay in the command line, an easy to use code editor is nano. nano is usually preinstalled with many distros, but you might need to install it.
### VSCode
Visual Studio Code is a fee code editor that can be used for nearly any language. It starts up fast, and is very intuitive to use. You can extend it's functionality with plugins to make it an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
### Sublime text
Some people swear by it. I personally never used it. If you have, please write a quick review here!
